    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      The client’s legacy risk reporting system was unable to handle increasing trade volumes and evolving regulatory needs. Reports were delayed, siloed across teams, and lacked transparency. Traders and risk managers often worked from inconsistent data snapshots, delaying key decisions.
